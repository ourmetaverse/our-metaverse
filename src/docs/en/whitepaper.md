# White Paper

The science fiction novel *Our Metaverse - The Beginning* (`our-metaverse.md` SHA256 Hash `C73F914CBFD8E9BF6CF3FE3E9A3488E1524CC777779035E01975778BAD1D971C`) is cast as NFT through an ethereum smart contract, which is addressed as `0xEcd0D12E21805803f70de03B72B1C162dB0898d9` and published by address `0x9C3C27d5bADb93fC2468f4cb12056b8C0C228ad8` (later replaced by `our-metaverse.eth`). A total of 3000 copies of this project NFT were released. 2998 of them are base NFTs, which require 0.01 ETH to be minted, and a maximum of 10 NFTs per address, the ownership of which represents the following rights and obligations.

1. obtain the membership of OurMetaverseDAO.
2. participate in revenue sharing, each NFT corresponds to a revenue sharing interest.
3. own the digital image artwork corresponding to the OurMetaverse NFT, which will be created in the future based on the fictional setting.
4. members of OurMetaverseDAO have the right to modify and translate all works contained in the OurMetaverseDAO collection in digital form and to create secondary works.
5. Commercial secondary creation of OurMetaverseDAO collections requires a contract interface `grant` authorization to include information about the secondary creation in the contract deposit, such as the contract address or content hash. There is no cost for the first deposit (except for the Gas fee), from the second 0.3 ETH, and then each time 0.3 ETH is added, the cost of the deposit will be divided equally among all NFTs, the logic has been implemented through a smart contract, guaranteed by the contract code.
6. Secondary creation of non-commercial digital works in the OurMetaverseDAO collection does not require a license and is available to all. For example, even if you are not a member of OurMetaverseDAO, you can make non-commercial translations of OurMetaverseDAO's works without the need for a depository license.
7. When a creator creates a second work through a depository license, that work is included in the OurMetaverseDAO collection and the rights to modify and translate the work are available to OurMetaverseDAO. The rights to adapt the work for film and television and the rights to publish the book are exclusively licensed to OurMetaverse NFT 0 and OurMetaverse NFT 1, respectively. 8.
In addition to the rights stated in this White Paper, all other rights to the work created by the creator are owned by the creator and exercised at the creator's discretion, such as offline t-shirts of the work.

For NFT #0 and NFT #1, the two special NFTs are as follows.
1. The special NFT will be temporarily cast and owned by the contract address when the contract is initialized, and everyone can call the contract method to purchase it, which means that the casting is completed and the corresponding rights and interests are enjoyed.
2. No.1 interest represents the publishing interest of offline books such as novels and picture books, priced at 30ETH, which needs to be authorized by the contract interface when issuing the corresponding offline goods, the first call does not cost (except for Gas fee), the second call needs 3ETH, and each time 3ETH is added. 3.
3. interest 0 represents the film and TV adaptation right, priced at 600ETH, and the corresponding offline product will be issued with the authorization of the contract interface `grant`, the first call will be free of charge (except for Gas fee), the second call will require 30ETH, and each time 30ETH will be added.
This logic has been implemented through a smart contract and is guaranteed by the contract code.

598 of the 2998 base NFTs will be retained by the contract launch address `our-metaverse.eth`, of which 500 (NFTs 100-599) will be used to attract more creators and projects in the future. Their use will be publicized in OurMetaverseDAO, and if there is already revenue included in the NFT, it will be used in a way determined by `our-metaverse.eth`. The other 98 copies (NFTs 2-99) and the proceeds of Mint are held and used by `our-metaverse.eth`.
