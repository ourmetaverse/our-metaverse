# About OurMetaverse

I have a dream: to create a wonderful and diverse universe. 

I also have a dream: I hope every creator can reap the value of creation.  

This is a Web3 experiment, an exploration of the creator economy. This is a project I personally started, but I hope to leverage the power of Web3 to create OurMetaverseDAO so that more people can participate in making these two dreams a reality.

I'm a programmer and I write science fiction during my spare time. I've already published some science fiction novels, even though I don't earn much money from it, I simply get a lot of joy from writing it. I write codes for a life and I don't count on creative writing to afford my bread and milk. But Most full time creators are not, especially those sci-fi writers. There are many creators who are much better than me while they even can't make a living from their writing and can only earn a couple of hundreds dollars for a novel of tens of thousands of words. The whole creator economy is not good, and the majority of profits from creative writings are monopoly by print giants, and creators' passionate are deeply frustrated  under the existing industry system. It is difficult to promote the circulation and secondary development of related rights and peripheral development, creators cannot get good income, good works are difficult to be discovered, consumers do not enjoy better works, and it is difficult for ordinary investors to participate in investment. But Web3 opened my eyes to endless possibilities, so I built this project.

The project is known as *Our Metaverse*, which is the name of the project and the name of a novel. and we formed a community named Our Metaverse DAO, because we have the faith that decentralized is our future. Based on the fantasy of the future of the metaverse, I conceived a new universe, which I called "Our Metaverse", and wrote a novel of more than 20,000 words. But I think it is just the beginning, I hope it can be extended and become a universe with infinite possibilities. By issuing a smart contract on ethereum to manage the copyright of this IP, I have granted the copyright to everyone who wants to make a secondary creation through my newly designed ERC721M smart contract(the creation incentive for writers is powered by our ERC721M), and we welcome those who want to write a brand new side story can participate in the project and enjoy the benefits of this IP together.

Everyone can become a member of OurMetaverse NFT through our website minting page to become a member of OurMetaverseDAO and own the NFT in addition to the corresponding digital image artwork and the rights related to *Our Metaverse*.

# Risk Disclose 

**Please read this document carefully before participating in the project to understand the risks involved.**

1. Either basic NFT or special NFT, once sold does not provide returns. I am just a normal writer, and cast NFTs may not be sold, or may even be worth zero. The purchase of a general interest is more of a purchase of a secondary creative license for Our Metaverse, so please do not maliciously hype it for someone who really wants to create a secondary work based on it. It is my expectation that it will be sold only when the secondary creative license is really needed so that more creators can join in at any time.
2. I am only an amateur science fiction writer, and *Our Metaverse - The Beginning* is more of a worldview, which contains a lot of incomplete information, in order to leave room for secondary creation, and it will contain a lot of content about blockchain, metaverse and Web3, which may not be friendly for general readers.
3. For the NFT corresponding image artwork, the creation has not yet started because we have not yet found an artist to work with. Please be cautious as there is no guarantee for the start date and content.
4. This is a personal project, entirely out of my love for Web3 and science fiction, hoping to realize my dream and contribute to Web3 and science fiction at the same time. I have limited personal ability and no organization to participate in marketing, so I can't guarantee that those who own the NFT will get the income, so please be careful to participate.
5. The various declarations and agreements on copyright involved in the project are only guaranteed by smart contracts and the contractual spirit of the Web3 world. Considering the differences in laws in different countries and regions and the imperfection of current digital copyright, coupled with my own lack of copyright-related knowledge, it may also bring certain risks to the subsequent normal operation of the project.

In addition to the above risks, the content in the novel *Our Metaverse - The Beginning* is a fantasy and a certain setting for the future, not a prediction, and does not represent the author's opinion, so please do not use it as investment advice. The opinions and actions of the characters in the text are for story effect only and do not represent the author's own views. In particular, some of the flirtations in the novel are more of a tribute as well as a setting from the character's point of view, so please do not take them personally. The author himself is a technical optimist and hopes that this project will make a small contribution to the development of Web3.

Here is the creation of *Our Metaverse*, *Our Metaverse - Genesis*, have fun reading it.
