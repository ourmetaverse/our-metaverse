 ### What is the goal of the project?

To continue to refine the IP through essay contests and other activities, to push for the eventual release of book publishing rights and film adaptation rights to allow OurMetaverseDAO members to generate revenue, and to realize their dream of creating a universe and bringing it to the big screen. Of course, this is a clear and immediate goal, and hopefully this experiment will drive OurMetaverseDAO and OurMetaverse IP forward, and we look forward to many more possibilities in the future.

### How will OurMetaverseDAO work?

There is no definitive plan for how OurMetaverseDAO will work, it is an experiment in itself and we expect to tweak the way the DAO works as the project evolves in the future. However, there are already some preliminary ideas, such as an essay contest in the future, in which members of OurMetaverseDAO will have the right to vote on their work. Subsequent recruitment of artists and translators will be prioritized from among OurMetaverseDAO members. The 500 NFTs reserved for the project will also be used to attract talented creators and operators to the governance of DAO, which is an evolving process.

### When will the image open?

This is an individual initiated project, no team. I have no design skills myself, so I will need to wait until NFT is released to generate revenue before I can seek collaborating artists to design the NFT images. I can't give an exact start date, but I will try to complete this goal by May 2022, and I welcome interested artists to contact me. The image will be based on the novel's story, but it will only serve as a memento, and I think the value of the OurMetaverse NFT is more that it represents the owner's copyright on the OurMetaverse IP.
